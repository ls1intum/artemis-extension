# README Management Summary

## ‚úÖ What I've Done

### 1. Updated Root README (`/README.md`)
**Purpose**: Developer and contributor documentation

**Key sections added/updated**:
- Clear indication this is the developer documentation
- Links to user documentation and documentation strategy
- Complete development setup instructions
- Detailed project structure with descriptions
- Architecture overview
- Build commands and scripts
- Testing and debugging guide
- Enhanced contributing guidelines

### 2. Created Extension README (`/iris-thaumantias/README.md`)
**Purpose**: User-facing documentation for VS Code Marketplace

**Key sections**:
- Feature highlights with emojis for better readability
- Getting started guide
- Available commands
- Extension settings
- Quick start instructions
- Support resources
- Focused on user benefits rather than technical details

### 3. Created Documentation Strategy Guide (`/DOCUMENTATION.md`)
**Purpose**: Explains how to maintain both READMEs

**Covers**:
- Why we have two README files
- When to update each one
- Alternative approaches (symlinks, generation)
- Current recommendation and rationale

## üìã Single README Strategy - Your Options

### Option 1: Two Separate READMEs (‚úÖ Recommended - Implemented)
**What**: Maintain two distinct files
- `/README.md` for developers
- `/iris-thaumantias/README.md` for users

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Each audience gets tailored content
- Easier to maintain specialized content

**Cons**:
- Need to update two files for shared information

### Option 2: Symlink Approach
**What**: Create one README and symlink to it
```bash
cd /Users/liamberger/Documents/private/artemis-extension
rm README.md
ln -s iris-thaumantias/README.md README.md
```

**Pros**:
- Only one file to maintain

**Cons**:
- GitHub root shows user docs (not ideal for contributors)
- Can't have developer-specific content at root

### Option 3: Automated Generation
**What**: Write a build script that generates one README from the other

**Pros**:
- Single source of truth
- Can extract specific sections

**Cons**:
- Complex to set up and maintain
- Requires documentation in comments/markers

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Keep the two-README approach** (already implemented). Here's why:

1. **VS Code Extension Best Practice**: Most successful extensions have separate docs
2. **Different Audiences**: Developers need build info; users need feature info
3. **Marketplace Requirements**: Extension README is bundled with the package
4. **Low Maintenance**: Shared content is minimal (mostly in "About Artemis" section)
5. **Professional**: Each audience gets exactly what they need

## üîÑ Maintenance Tips

### When You Add a New Feature:
1. ‚úèÔ∏è Update `iris-thaumantias/README.md` with user-facing description
2. ‚úèÔ∏è Update root `README.md` only if it affects the architecture/development

### When You Change Build Process:
1. ‚úèÔ∏è Update root `README.md` with new build instructions
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip `iris-thaumantias/README.md` (users don't need this)

### When Artemis Platform Changes:
1. ‚úèÔ∏è Update "About Artemis" section in BOTH files
2. üé® Adjust tone: technical in root, user-friendly in extension

## üìÅ File Locations

- **Developer docs**: `/README.md`
- **User docs**: `/iris-thaumantias/README.md`
- **Strategy guide**: `/DOCUMENTATION.md`
- **Extension manifest**: `/iris-thaumantias/package.json`

## üöÄ Next Steps

You're all set! The documentation is now properly structured. Going forward:

1. Use the root README for development/contribution info
2. Use the extension README for user-facing features
3. Reference DOCUMENTATION.md if you forget which is which
4. Both READMEs are now up to date with your extension's actual features

Enjoy your well-documented extension! üéâ
