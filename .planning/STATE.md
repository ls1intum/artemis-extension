# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-28)

**Core value:** Students can interact with Artemis courses, exercises, and the Iris AI tutor without leaving VS Code.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Phase 16 — Integration Test Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 16 of 20 (Integration Test Infrastructure)
Plan: 02 complete, 03 next
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — 16-02 complete: fixture factories + bridge contract tests

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20% (v1.2, 2/3 Phase 16 plans done) — v1.0 + v1.1 complete (15 phases, 62 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Milestone (Complete):**
- Phases: 7 (24 plans) | Total time: 1.88 hours | Avg/plan: 5.7 min

**v1.1 Milestone (Complete):**
- Phases: 8 (38 plans) | Timeline: 3 days | 167 commits
- Phase 8: 15 min | Phase 9: 7 min | Phase 10: 10 min | Phase 11: 16 min
- Phase 12: ~110 min | Phase 13: ~115 min | Phase 14: ~20 min | Phase 15: 4 min

**v1.2 Milestone (In Progress):**
- Phase 16 Plan 01: 7 min | 2 tasks | 3 files
- Phase 16 Plan 02: ~3 min | 2 tasks | 14 files | 61 new tests (876 total)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Framework decision: keep `vscode-extension-tester` 8.22.0 — wdio-vscode-service has no sidebar webview iframe support; Playwright excluded (issue #22351)
- Test architecture: sandwich testing — Vitest for webview side, Mocha + @vscode/test-electron for host side, vscode-extension-tester for Selenium UI
- No new packages required — entire stack already installed
- Store reset pattern: direct getState() reference (not structuredClone/JSON.parse) + setState(state, true) replace flag; configurable:true required on initial acquireVsCodeApi defineProperty for re-definition in beforeEach
- Fixture factory pattern: Partial<XxxMessage['payload']> override parameter with spread after minimal defaults — return type annotation enforces shape, no type assertions needed
- createGenericInitPayload takes view as required first arg (not override) because view is the state machine discriminator

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Critical pitfalls (Phase 16-01 resolved two of these):**
- ~~Zustand store state leaks~~ — RESOLVED: resetTestState() in global beforeEach (16-01)
- ~~Bridge handshake helper missing~~ — RESOLVED: simulateHandshake() with act() wrapping (16-01)
- postMessage dropped before webview listener ready — handled by simulateHandshake() pattern established in 16-01

**Watch items (not blockers yet):**
- Authenticated E2E test strategy — decide env-var credentials vs test-mode bypass at Phase 20 planning
- Vitest memory pressure if test count exceeds ~1200 — monitor, remediate with separate project config if needed

## Session Continuity
